This is a tool for analysing graphs, by adding 2 lines that the value bounces to over time.

this is a demo file that generates a random graph and draws on the lines.

what to expect:
- not too much in general
- a program to generate random price-time graphs 
- a program to generate the parallel lines over the main line on the graph
